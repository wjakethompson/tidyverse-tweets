*This repository and Twitter bot are no longer active. Due to changes in leadership at Twitter and unstabilitiy in the Twitter API, this project was archived.*

This is a Twitter bot that scrapes the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) API and the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) page to find new questions related to the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/), and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) suites of packages. Scraping is done with the [{stackr}](https://github.com/dgrtwo/stackr) and [{feedeR}](https://github.com/datawookie/feedeR) packages, and tweets are posted to the [@tidyversetweets](https://twitter.com/tidyversetweets) account using the [{rtweet}](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/index.html) package.
